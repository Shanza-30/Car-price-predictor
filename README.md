This project is an Interactive Car Price Prediction Web Application that leverages machine learning models to provide users with accurate estimates of car prices. It combines Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor to ensure reliable predictions based on multiple car features. Users can input up to 33 different attributes, including technical specifications like engine type, horsepower, fuel type, mileage, transmission, and other categorical variables such as car brand, model, and fuel category.

The application is built using Python and Flask, providing a clean, intuitive, and user-friendly web interface. Users simply enter the car details, and the app instantly predicts the car price, making it suitable for car buyers, sellers, and enthusiasts who want quick insights into vehicle valuations.

The backend uses data preprocessing, feature engineering, and trained ML models to ensure predictions are accurate and consistent. The project demonstrates the integration of machine learning with web development, showcasing how data science can be translated into practical, real-world applications.

Key Highlights:

Supports 33 input features for detailed prediction.

Uses Linear Regression for baseline predictions.

Uses Random Forest Regressor for improved accuracy.

Built with Flask, providing a responsive web interface.

Ideal for learning, experimentation, and practical price estimation.
